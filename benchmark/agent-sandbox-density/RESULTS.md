# Results

This file holds the reviewed, committed summary of actual benchmark runs —
not the raw per-run logs (those land under `results/`, gitignored, one
timestamped file per run; see `scripts/lib.sh`'s `resource_snapshot` /
`run_density_loop`). Copy the relevant numbers here once a run is complete
and worth keeping as a reference point.

### 2026-08-23 — bare-metal, AMD Ryzen 9 5900X (12c/24t), 125GB RAM host

Hard cap per VM: 8 vCPU / 48GiB RAM / 200GB disk (Incus KVM VM)
Sandbox profile: cpu 100m/200m, mem 128Mi/256Mi (control); cpu 200m mem 256Mi request==limit (Containarium — see "Fairness notes")
Containarium version: v0.66.0    Agent-sandbox version: v0.5.1    K8s version: v1.30.14 (kubeadm)
Both groups ran under the same `runsc` (gVisor) RuntimeClass — see README.md "What's actually under test".

| | k8s + agent-sandbox (control) | Containarium (experiment) |
|---|---|---|
| Sandboxes reached Ready/RUNNING | **69** | **34** |
| Attempted (incl. failures) | 72 | 37 |
| Node CPU requests at stop | 8000m / 8000m (**100%**) | 7900m / 8000m (**98%**) |
| Node memory at stop | 18% | 18% |
| Wall-clock for the density loop | ~7 min | ~5 min |
| Image | `busybox:1.36` | `containarium-agent-box:v0.66.0` (see "Fairness notes" — required, not a choice) |

**Both sides were CPU-request-bound, not memory-bound** — memory sat at
18% on both when the stopping rule triggered; the ceiling in both cases
was Kubernetes CPU admission, confirmed via `kubectl describe node`
"Allocated resources" at the stopping point.

**The ~2x gap tracks the CPU-request asymmetry almost exactly, not
gVisor.** Containarium's boxes request 200m each (`create --cpu/--memory`
sets request==limit, no separate request knob); the control group's pods
request only 100m each (limit 200m). 69 × 100m ≈ 6900m + ~1100m system
overhead ≈ 8000m (100%); 34 × 200m = 6800m + similar system overhead ≈
7900m (98%). Halving the control group's count (69/2 ≈ 34.5) lands almost
exactly on Containarium's actual result (34) — consistent with the
documented prediction in README.md's "Fairness notes" that this asymmetry
should roughly halve Containarium's density, independent of gVisor.

**gVisor confirmed live on every unit, both sides** — `uname -r` inside a
sample pod from each group returned `4.19.0-gvisor`; the post-run
"pods by RuntimeClass" snapshot in each run's raw log
(`results/*.md`, gitignored) shows every `sbdens-*`/`box` pod scheduled
under `runsc`.

Notes / anomalies:
- This was the first real end-to-end run of these scripts and surfaced
  (and fixed, in earlier commits on this PR) several real bugs along the
  way: the base VM image ships without sshd/cloud-init; a `kubectl wait`
  race on Calico pods; gVisor registered under the wrong containerd
  plugin ID on containerd v2.x; `jq`/`git` missing from the base image;
  a Helm chart bug where `gateway.namespace=""` breaks install outright;
  `create`'s default `--image` isn't valid on the k8s backend
  (filed [#1524](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/issues/1524));
  and `containarium list` is entirely broken on the k8s backend
  (filed [#1525](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/issues/1525)).
  The chart bug is filed as [#1526](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/issues/1526).
  None of these affect the validity of the numbers above — all were
  provisioning-time or CLI-ergonomics issues, worked around before the
  density loops ran — but they're worth fixing upstream regardless of
  this benchmark.
- `kubectl top nodes` was unavailable (no metrics-server installed) — CPU
  request/limit accounting from `kubectl describe node` was used instead,
  which is what actually gates scheduling anyway.
- Neither side hit the sandbox-resource-profile's *memory* limit at all;
  a re-run with a much higher `VM_CPUS` (see README.md's estimation
  discussion) would more directly isolate gVisor's own per-pod cost from
  the CPU-admission ceiling, since CPU is the bottleneck at this VM size.
